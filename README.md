Kerbal-Transfer-Calc
====================

Orbital Transfer 

There are a plethora of orbital transfer calculators available online for the super awesome game Kerbal Space Program. 
But, if you are anything like me, you play the game fully maximized for maximal enjoyment.. maximum. This makes the use
of these online calculators fairly difficult so I am attempting to create an app that will have the same form and 
function as these calculators. This is my first android app development attempt, outside of their "Hello World" example,
so expect things to be fairly kludgy.. kludgey.. kludegy.. one of those. Feel free to fork and help out or comment on
what I am making, Cheers!
